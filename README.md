# Task:
  Create a Dashboard to create visualizations for findings clients demographics.
    
# Findings:
    1. In terms of monthly data, March had the highest number of clients at 282, followed by October and January. February had the lowest number of clients at 218.
    2. Across all 12 months, the count of clients ranged from 218 to 282.
    3. The age group of clients between 45-55 had the highest amount of bank loans, while the age group of 15-25 had the lowest amount.
    4. There is a correlation between the total properties owned and the total number of credit cards within the age group of 500-700. However, it diverges the most when the age group is between 35-45.
    5. Between 1992-2019, the bank accounts that had a low fee structure experienced an increase in the sum of bank deposits, while the accounts that had a high fee structure had a decrease in deposit sum.
    6. Retail banking relationships had the highest number of clients, followed by institutional, commercial, and private banks.
    7. Clients Brian Flores, Phillip Hansen, and Joseph Fuller had the highest risk weightage.
    8. There are more female clients than male clients.
    9. The sum of business lending is comparatively higher than the sum of bank deposits.
    10. The amount in checking accounts and savings accounts is more than that of foreign currency accounts.

# Recommendations:
    1. Focus on marketing efforts for attracting clients during months with historically lower client counts such as February, to increase client acquisition.
    2. Develop loan products specifically for age group 15 - 25, to increase loan portfolio diversification and profitablity.
    3. offer personalized wealth management services to clients in age group 35 - 45 to address the divergence in property and credit card ownership trends, potentially increasing client retention and satisfaction.
    4. Review and potentially adjust fee structures for bank accounts to align with client preferences and behaviors. 
    5. Consider offering incentives for clients with low fee structure to encourage higher bank deposit sum.
    6. Strengthen client relationships, particularly with clients having high risk weightage, to mitigate potential risks and enhance client satisfaction.
    7. Promote savings and checking accounts as well as foreign currency accounts, to encourage clients to maximize their savings and investment potential, leading to increased bank deposit sums and revenue generation for the bank.
